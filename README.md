# Fuel Name Registry

# ETHCC Hackathon Submission


## Inspiration

The main inspiration for FNS is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). ENS reached a significant adoption since its launch. Today, an Ethereum user can register a ENS domain ,forward to their address and use their name as public address instead of hexadecimal address

## What it does

FNS provide a way for users to map human readable names to blockchain addresses. Using FNS, Fuel Network users can transfer funds without knowing long hexadecimal addresses. Instead, they can use short and meaningful domains. Let’s say Alice will send 1 ETH to Bob. Alice will have to know Bob’s address. But if they both had FNS domains, Alice could send 1 ETH to bob.fuel easily.


## How I built it



## Challenges I ran into

A new language - no “public” implementation of erc721 - no example for fuels-ts - no public testnet - no dependency add subcommand in package manager


## Accomplishments that I am proud of

An erc721 impl. - Add subcommand for Forc package manager - Name Registry System


## What I learned

Sway - How ENS works - 


## What's next for Fuel Name Service

Fuel users should have domains and transfer tokens without knowing their hexadecimal addresses. Fuel Name Service should be publicly available after a testnet period. I have to work close with Fuel Labs in this process.

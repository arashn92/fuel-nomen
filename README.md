# Fuel Name Registry

# ETHCC Hackathon Submission

Decentralized name systems, ENS, Namecoin, Avvy, PNS.

## Inspiration

Fuels users can transfer without knowing long hexadecimal addresses. Instead, they can use short and meaningful domains. Let’s say Alice will send 1 ETH to Bob. Alice will have to know Bob’s address. But if they both had FNS domains, Alice could send 1 ETH to bob.fuel easily.

## What it does

## How I built it

A new language - no “public” implementation of erc721 - no example for fuels-ts - no public testnet - no dependency add subcommand in package manager


## Challenges I ran into

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

An erc721 impl. - Add subcommand for Forc package manager - Name Registry System


## What I learned

Sway - How ENS works - 


## What's next for Fuel Name Service

Fuel users should have domains and transfer tokens without knowing their hexadecimal addresses. Fuel Name Service should be publicly available after a testnet period. I have to work close with Fuel Labs in this process.
